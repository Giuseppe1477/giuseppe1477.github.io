    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="font-size:16px;">
      My name is Giuseppe Celentano and I am currently in my senior year at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). 
      I am majoring in Computer Science and will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in the Spring of 2022. I currently hold a GPA of 3.54 at NJIT. 
      I have my Associate in Science Degree in Computer Science from County College of Morris and graduated Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.59. 
      I also hold a Certificate of Achievment in Information Security from the County College of Morris. 
      I have attended a few hacking competitions with the Cyber Security Club at the college too. On top of my computer skills, I also have leadership skills. 
      I was in the Boy Scouts of America for eight years and became an Eagle Scout after seven years in scouting while also attending a National Youth 
      Leadership Training Conference that teaches important leadership skills. Computer Science and all of its 
      related topics are intiguing to me and I enjoy learning about the field. I am constantly learning and creating new projects
      on Github and Google Colab that you can view below if you wish. Take a look at some of my projects that are linked on my website.
