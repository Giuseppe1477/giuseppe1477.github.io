    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">
      My name is Giuseppe Celentano and I am a currently a Test Automation Engineer for the Department of Defense.
      I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology as well as
      a Certificate of Merit in Information Security from the County College of Morris.
      Many of the technologies I am fluent in are currently used heavily in the computer science field such as Java, Python, HTML, Windows, Linux, and more.
      Computer Science and its related topics are intiguing to me and I enjoy learning about the field. I am constantly learning and creating new projects
      on Github and Google Colab that you can view below if you wish. Take a look at some of my projects shown in the 'My Projects' section of my website.
