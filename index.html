      My name is Giuseppe Celentano and I am a college graduate from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 
      I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and graduated Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.5.
      I also hold a Certificate of Merit in Information Security from the County College of Morris. 
      I have attended hacking competitions with the Cyber Security Club and also attended solo hackathons. 
      On top of my computer skills, I also have leadership skills. 
      I earned the Eagle Scout Award in Boy Scouts and also attended a National Youth Leadership Training Conference that teaches important leadership skills. 
      Computer Science and its related topics are intiguing to me and I enjoy learning about the field. I am constantly learning and creating new projects
