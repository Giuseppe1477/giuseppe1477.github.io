    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Giuseppe Celentano and I am currently in my senior year at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). 
      I am majoring in Computer Science and will graduate in the Spring of 2022. I currently hold a GPA of 3.54 at NJIT. 
      I have my Associates Degree in Computer Science from County College of Morris and graduated Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.59. 
      I also hold a Certificate of Achievment in Information Security from the County College of Morris. 
      I attended a few hacking competitions with the Cyber Security Club at the college too. Computer Science and all of its 
      related topics are intiguing to me and I enjoy learning about the field. I am constantly learning and creating new projects
      on Github and Google Colab that you can view below if you wish. Take a look at some of my projects that are linked on my website.
