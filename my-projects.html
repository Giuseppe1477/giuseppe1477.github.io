      <h3>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictor</h3><br>
      <img src="/images/btcPricePredictor.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Predictor" style="width:500px;height:342px;">
      <br>Bitcoin Price Predictor written in Python that takes the closing price of BTC per day from the past few
      years to predict a specific month's closing price on each day. The graph included is the real price for the test
      month versus the predicted price. There is also an experimental version of the predictor that uses Amazon DeepAR
      instead of regression. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R3cpQq6rJAhdUpNQtokw8Oh2rvf4mAhm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">View Code</a><br>

      <br><p>&emsp;Untrained Snake AI &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Trained Snake AI Using DQN Learning</p>
      This AI program was written in Python and uses deep learning to learn how to play the game. It works by assigning a reward value and a penalty value to certain actions, 
      like 10 pts for eating the food, and -10 pts for crashing into itself or the wall. I then attempts to maximize this score by making actions based on certain states.
      States include danger-left, danger-right, danger-front, and the same for food. When first starting, the snake scores randomly and usually dies within a few seconds,
      but after about 20-30 minutes of training the snake can reach scores of about 20-35 pts.

      <br>This is a website that was a collaboration between two NJIT students and myself. It is a social media page focused on talking about and sharing music 
      and music related topics. It was designed to be used for a smaller target audience like a college campus, a high school, a club/organization, or any 
      other small to medium sized group. A video showing the website is shown below but if you would like to explore the website further, contact me and I 
      can give you a set of login credentials. The site remains private to prevent tampering. Features of the website include online/offline instant messaging, 
      rich-text and image posts, comments, admin functions such as creating users and blocking content, Spotify integration, view accounts' Spotify favorites, 
      Soundcloud and Youtube Music integrations, and profile search. This is a working prototype that is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

      Linked below is a public Google Drive folder that includes various data science projects I have completed including the BitCoin Price Predictor shown above.
      All of the code is written in Python and they run similarly to Jupiter Notebook.
