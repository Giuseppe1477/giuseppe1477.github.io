      <h3>Social Media Music Website</h3><br>
      This is a website that was a collaboration between two NJIT students and myself. It is a social media page focused on talking about and sharing music 
      and music related topics. It was designed to be used for a smaller target audience like a college campus, a high school, a club/organization, or any 
      other small to medium sized group. A video showing the website is shown below but if you would like to explore the website further, contact me and I 
      can give you a set of login credentials. The site remains private to prevent tampering<br>

    <h2>Google Colab Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Google Colab is an online and shareable platform that allows users to share and run Python code. 
      is similar to Jupiter Notebook and mainly used for data science projects. 
      Linked below I have a few data science projects that you can run that include 
      implementing a recurrent neural network to predict pictures of clothing, a Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictor Algorithm that predicts a month's BTC closing price per day,
      and other projects. Programs may be added or pulled to the collection.<br>
