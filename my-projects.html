    <h1>Google Colab Projects</h1>
    <p>
      Google Colab is an online and shareable platform that allows users to share and run Python code. It is similar to Jupiter Notebook and mainly used for data science projects. Linked below I have a few data science projects that you can run that include implementing a recurrent neural network to predict pictures of clothing, a Bitcoin (BTC) Price Predictor Algorithm that predicts a month's BTC closing price per day, and other projects. Programs may be added or pulled to the collection.<br>
